## Android app for EEG data recording with the Traumschreiber

We design an Android app to collect, plot, record, save, manage, and share EEG sessions, using the [Traumschreiber EEG device](https://www.traumschreiber.uni-osnabrueck.de/). The app also presents reliable information about epilepsy and counts with a chatbot expert in epilepsy, with whom the user can chat to evacuate doubts about these topics.

An architecture was design with a total of 10 different modules. In this architecture, the main functionality of the app was split between the different modules. As a result of the implementation phase, we produced a reliable and stable app, which allows the user to collect, plot, record, save, manage and share EEG sessions, as well as learn about epilepsy and EEG.
