# Traumschreiber
The Traumschreiber system is the subject of several theses covering different research areas within Cognitive Science and Neuroinformatics. Here, the theses are collected. The following gives a brief summary of the individual projects.

App Development

"Developing and designing a mediator smartphone application for portable sleep EEG recording and biofeedback with focus on the end user experience" - M. JÃ¤kel, Bachelor's Thesis (February 2017)

This thesis reports on the implementation of a prototype Android application that introduces users to the sleep mask. With the app, users can, among other, connect the Traumschreiber via Bluetooth to their phones, enabling them to visualize recorded EEG data.

"Design and implementation of an Android app
to record, store and manage EEG signals", R. A. Rojas Campos, Master's Thesis (August 2019)

This thesis describes the most advanced Traumschreiber app to date. With the Android app, the user can collect, plot, save, manage, and share EEG sessions, recorded with the Traumschreiber system. It furthermore introduces a chatbot expert, used to inform the user about epilepsy and present general information about epilepsy in a clear and accessible way. The code is available [on this GitHub Link missing!]
