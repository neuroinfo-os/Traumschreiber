# Traumschreiber
The Traumschreiber system is the subject of several theses covering different research areas within Cognitive Science and Neuroinformatics. Here, the theses are collected. The following gives a brief summary of the individual projects.

## App Development

### _Developing and designing a mediator smartphone application for portable sleep EEG recording and biofeedback with focus on the end user experience_ - M. JÃ¤kel, Bachelor's Thesis (February 2017)

This thesis reports on the implementation of a prototype Android application that introduces users to the sleep mask. With the app, users can, among other, connect the Traumschreiber via Bluetooth to their phones, enabling them to visualize recorded EEG data.

### _Design and implementation of an Android app
to record, store and manage EEG signals_, R. A. Rojas Campos, Master's Thesis (August 2019)

This thesis describes the most advanced Traumschreiber app to date. With the Android app, the user can collect, plot, save, manage, and share EEG sessions, recorded with the Traumschreiber system. It furthermore introduces a chatbot expert, used to inform the user about epilepsy and presents general information about epilepsy in a clear and accessible way. At the moment the code is available [at this Repository](https://github.com/adrocampos/EEG-Droid) but will soon be included in this one.

## Detection of Even Related Potentials with the Traumschreiber


### _Measuring vMMN, P300 and AEPs
with a mobile EEG system_, M. Reimann, Bachelor's Thesis (September 2018)

Within this thesis the potential of the Traumschreiber as mobile EEG system is explored by evaluating its usability and ability to detect event-related potentials (ERP). It is shown that the device is able to produce good and very good results for the ERP under consideration.


### _Analyzing event-related potentials in
8-channel EEG data using machine
learning methods_, A.-K. Schalkamp, Bachelor's Thesis (September 2018)

This thesis describes a study performed to evaluate whether EEG data acquired with the Traumschreiber can be used with traditional and single-trial analysis. Furthermore, it expands on the importance of electrode placement.

### _Auditory Evoked Potentials with Mobile EEG_, M. Vidal De Palol, Master's Thesis (March 2019)

This project combines the development of an Android App for real-time EEG visualization and recording and an experiment to assess the capability of the device for recording Auditory Evoked Potentials.
