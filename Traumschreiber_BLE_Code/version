works:
	fetching AD data
		reads data in 32 Byte packets from one AD
		writing in ring buffer
			not since compression was added, but code is still there, commented out
	compression added
		fft based compression for each channel is integrated
			has own buffers for each channel
	sending via BLE
		sending via BLE (and fetching AD data) if other device is connected and has enabled notifications (both nicely triggered on BLE-events)
		packets to be send are stored in ring buffer
		max 20 Byte packets
		trying to fill send buffer on each recieved AD packet or if data was sent via BLE
	data generation added
		can be toggeled via flag. this then deactivates spi
		
		
constraints:
	8 channels
	datarate: according to incoming AD packets (~250Hz)
	no error output via BLE


comments:
	it crashes after a few seconds when sending AD data, but works with generated data...
