works:
	fetching AD data
		in 32 Byte packets
		writing in ring buffer
	sending via BLE
		only fetching/sending if other device is connected and has enabled notifications (both nicely triggered on BLE-events)
		transfering to second ring buffer
		in 20 Byte packets
		trying to fill send buffer on each recieved AD packet or if data was sent (via BLE)
	'compression' added
		sending first 6 channels in full width, dropping the last two
	data generation added
		can be toggeled via flag.
		data gets generated every time a sample from the AD's came in
		it is possible to have generated and sampled data (see below)
	configuration characteristic, 1 Byte
		xxoo oooo: gain (00: 1, 01: 2, 10: 4, 11:8)
		ooxo oooo: generate data (0: off, 1: on)
		ooox oooo: if set, replace half of the generated data by real data (only works together with the option above, obviously)
		
		
constraints:
	8 channels (from one AD)
		due to 'compression', sending first 6 channels in full width
	datarate: according to incoming AD packets (~250Hz)
	no error output yet
