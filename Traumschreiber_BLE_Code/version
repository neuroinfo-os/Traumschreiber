works:
	fetching AD data
		from all 3 AD's in parallel
		in 32 Byte packets each
		if data from all 3 is there and send buffer has space: try to filter/encode, write to send buffer and then send
	sending via BLE
		packages are (by default) distributed over three characteristics
		only fetching/sending if other device is connected and has enabled notifications on all three characteristics (both nicely triggered on BLE-events)
		in 20 Byte packets
		trying to send on each recieved AD packet or if data has been sent (via BLE)
	filtering
		biquad cascade IIR filter from arm_math package for M4
			one instance per channel
		turned on by default, deactivated if dummy data is transmitted
	encoding
		put all 24 channels in 1.5 packages as difference (dcpm) values with 10Bit each
			values are shifted (aka least significant Bits are dropped) according to current variance
			amount of shifting is pushed out via 'C0DE' characteristic every 1000 data points as indication
		old code is still there, activatable via compilation flag
			(sending first 6 channels of first AD in full width, dropping the rest)
	dummy data generation
		can be toggeled via config characteristic (see below)
		data gets generated every time a sample from the ADs come in
		it is possible to have generated and sampled data (see below)
		only generates 8 channels anyways
	configuration characteristic (4 Bytes total)
		1st Byte:
			xxoo oooo: gain (00: 1, 01: 2, 10: 4, 11:8)
			ooxo oooo: generate data (0: off, 1: on), this disables/enables filtering (no filtering with dummy data)
			ooox oooo: if set, replace half of the generated data by real data (only works together with the option above, obviously)
			oooo xooo: if set, battery status is aquired and written in the following two Bytes. currently dummy data (0x102) is written, because there is a bug still. this bit is then unset by Traumschreiber.
			oooo oxoo: if set, data is only send via first characteristic
		2nd Byte:
			xxxx oooo: slowdown (1: ~4/5, 2: 3/5, 3: 1/2, ...), experimental debug feature
			reserved
		3rd and 4th Byte: debug/controll data. for example battery status.
		
		
constraints:
	datarate: sampled down from 500 to 167Hz
		still 250Hz of packages is send
	error output
		none, if transmitting with new encoding
