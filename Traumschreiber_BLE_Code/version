works:
	fetching AD data
		in 32 Byte packets
		writing in ring buffer
	sending via BLE
		only fetching/sending if other device is connected and has enabled notifications (both nicely triggered on BLE-events)
		transfering to second ring buffer
		in 20 Byte packets
		trying to fill send buffer on each recieved AD packet or if data was sent (via BLE)
	compression added
		sending first 6 channels in full width
	data generation added
		can be toggeled via flag. this then deactivates spi
	configuration characteristic, 1 Byte
		xxoo oooo: gain
		ooxo oooo: generate data
		
		
constraints:
	8 channels
	datarate: according to incoming AD packets (~250Hz)
	no error output yet
