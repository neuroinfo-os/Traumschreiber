Compilation and programming the Traumschreiber were tested with Segger Embedded Studio (SES).
https://www.segger.com/downloads/embedded-studio

for compiling one needs the Nordic SDK 15.3
https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Software/nRF5-SDK/Download
(downloading it with only softdevice s132 is sufficient for use with Traumschreiber)


to compile the code:
- store code folder in the SDK folder at:
SDK/examples/ble_peripheral
- open SES
- choose File -> 'open solution' and navigate to:
SDK/examples/ble_peripheral/<code folder>/pca10040/s132/ses/
- and click the .em-file

the main files are
main.c
traumschreiber_service.c/.h
ad_spi.c/.h

to programm the Traumschreiber:
- compile the project in SES (I use the key F7, should show two partly green bars on the bottom when finished)
- connect the programming board and connect the Traumschreiber to that one with the grey 10-Pin-Connector
- switch the Traumschreiber on!!!!
- use 'Target' -> 'Connect J-Link'
- use 'Target' -> 'Download ble_app_...'
during programming the Traumschreiber LEDs should be off. when finished it should be on.
